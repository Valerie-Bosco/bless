# the idea with this script is that you can create custom blender collection modules
# these modules will have configurations based on the collections property
# these collections will act as special folders for objects
# and will decide on how the objects are exported into gltf


# something like:

class Game:
    game_name = "New Game Project"
    filepath = ""
    
    engine = ["godot", "unity", "unreal", "generic"]
    


class GameWorld:

    # use your own language and terminologies.
    name = "map"
    description = ""

    export = None # export settings go here?, in 4.2 you can export per collection.

    collisions = True
    collision_type = "convex"
    convex_split = False



# the user fills this with collection modules in blender and godot
world_containers : list[GameWorld] 


class bless_GameFile:
    data = {}
    # then we start to make a json, or some other text format.
    for stuff in world_containers:
        data += stuff
