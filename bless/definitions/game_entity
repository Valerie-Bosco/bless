# idea for now.
import bpy


# the idea with this script is to make a file called "entities.bless"
# this will be generated inside your game's project folder
# and can be used to share data from bless and the game outside of the gltf file.

# for example, the user creates custom entities in blender or godot





# TODO entity prop class goes here.



# make bless file.
